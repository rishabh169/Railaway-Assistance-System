#Problem Description<br />

Indian Railways is the backbone of country’s transportation. Around 3 crores passengers travel by trains every day. There are many times when we need to reserve our seats but due to unavailability of seats we have to bear the inconvenience. In that case we either travel by planes paying the high prices of tickets or we travel uncomfortably by bus wasting a lot of time. There are times when seats are not available from our location, but they are available from a previous or next station because there is a fixed number of seats reserved for every station in Indian Railways. In that case we can book our seats and travel comfortably but it’s not possible to go and check the availability of seats for every station, that will just take a lot of time. Also, the seats in those cases remain empty and that’s a loss for Indian Railways too. So, an effective algorithm is needed which can give us the best possible solution with low cost that will benefit both the passengers and the Indian Railways.<br />


#Solution<br />

Suppose we need to travel from destination A to B but seats are unavailable. Now there is a possibility that we can break our journey in many parts. If C is an intermediate station, then we can book from A to C and then from C to B according to the availability of seats. Similarly, many combinations are possible. Our program will give the best possible solution with low cost if seats are unavailable from destination A to B by analysing all the possible combinations and checking extensively for the required journey. By this we will easily be able to travel from destination A to B without changing the trains. We will be developing a website where all the information will be shown.<br />
